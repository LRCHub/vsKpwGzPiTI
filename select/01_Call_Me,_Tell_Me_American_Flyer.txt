Call me?
Tell me?
We should meet tomorrow
Well, I can't see things quite your way

But I think that I could show you
Things that lie below
Your thoughts and words
And your gardens
And your stained glass daze

Times you come to me
And said you don't know how
Well, I think that there might be something wrong

You could change your thoughts before I go
But then you know that you were right
Where I wanted you and you didn't know
You were meant to worship and to choose
Anything you want
But now it looks like you will loose

All the things you needed
When you were the one
They can't be found
You know they just begun
To crumble all around you
Can you see them tumble down
Without a thought or a care for you
Or what you do.
